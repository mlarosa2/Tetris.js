# Tetris.js
A JavaScript Implementation of Tetris


##MVP

At minimum, Tetris.js will need to hold pieces on a board, take input to move those pieces on the board, and get more challenging as time goes on.

##Technologies, Libraries, APIs

Tetris.js will be built with vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API.

##Implementation Timeline

###Phase One

Develop a board that can hold pieces. The board will need to keep track of where pieces are and also be responsible for sending information about whether a line should be cleared, score information, and as to whether or not the game is over.

###Phase Two

During phase two, pieces will be brought to life and respond to keyboard input. They will also be programmed to fall to the bottom of the board at a specific rate.

###Phase Three

In phase three, piece rotation will be implemented. Alone with piece rotation, the game will become more difficult as the score builds up.
